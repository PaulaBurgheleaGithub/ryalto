## Ryalto Developer Blog Page Project

This was one of the design callanges they have asked us to complete. I have chosen to improve their [Developer Page](https://developer.ryalto.group/) and create a more responsive design as well as making some changes for the mobile layout.
I have decised to play/expore using CSS subgird for this project. It is not fully suported on all browsers but I am sure that will change in the future.
I also came across @contained querry selectors during my research and I've used it for my project. This aggain is not fully supported but I hade way to much fun playing with it and nesting CSS.


### Technologies Used

- HTML5 (used <article> tag where it was need and added a few "hidden" span tags for SR only)
- CSS3 (subgird and @contained query selector)
- JavaScript (mainly for the mobile menu interration)
